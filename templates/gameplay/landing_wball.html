          <h4>About</h4>
          <p>Open wiffleball was started by a disgruntled wiffleball player, who was tired of the league elders 
	    taking game data and cooking up wild plots of their pitching data.  This lead to many disputes, and
	    equally wild accusations about league elders.  The automation of the scoring process here aims to eliminate
	    those kinds of problems.</p>

          <h4>Why Open?</h4>
          <p>As per the about there has been an increasing desire to keep the tallying of season stats as transparent 
	    as possible.  Another reason is to invite others to contribute to the source code, especially with respect to
	    graphing and analytics functionality, that can be used by all openwiffleball users to improve their scores.</p>

          <h4>Why Wiffleball?</h4>
          <p>If you really need to ask this question, we'd like to ask you to leave the site immediately.  For those of you that didn't just 
	    listen to our instructions, we'll reward you with a history lesson.  Wiffleball was founded originally by a group of union
	    soldiers during the civil war in order to escape the harsh realities of war life.  Eventually some conniving southern soldiers
	    developed a knock-off game they called baseball.  The relative success of baseball over wiffleball since then as a national past-time
	    has since been a source of great discomfort to wiffleball enthusiasts to this day.</p>
